    "In this code I simulate intervals for an fMRI experiment, trying to minimize the correlation between variables. All simualtions were done prior to data collection.\n",
    "The experiment I am simulating here is the fmri counterfactual task, that includes multiple phases. I simulate ITIs, and when relevant, ISIs, for each of the phases seperately. \n",
    "Note that for all phases of this experiment (expect for Outcome Learning) there are only two predictors we know of ahead of time. With two predictors there is always an anti correlation, so we can't use correlation as a proxy for minimization, we therefore use VIF scores as suggested by Janeatte. \n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure of simulation here is: (1) simulate ITIs from a truncated exponential distribution, (2) compute VIF and Efficiency scores for every combination of run and version. In every simulation we control for the number of repeated same-condition trials in the critical condition, and we try to spread out the long ITIs across the trials so as to better the experience of the subject and to allow the signal to go down. (3) select the best designs with the smallest VIF scores and save these data sets. \n"

Collinearity is only worrisome when it involves the contrasts of interest in a study. This illustration of an unlikely go/nogo task shows high VIF on a regressor-by-regressor basis is actually fine since the VIF for the contrasts is well controlled (VIF<5). Reminder: High VIF is only a concern if studying that specific parameter, as that parameter's estimate is likely to have high variability if the VIF is elevated.\n",
